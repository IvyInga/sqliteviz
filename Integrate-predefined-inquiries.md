If you run sqliteviz on your own server you can specify predefined inquiries.
These inquiries will appear in `Inquiries` list for all users working with
sqliteviz on your server.

To create a list of predefined inquiries choose inquiries in `Inquiries` list
and export them to `inquiries.json`. Then (re)place this file on the server in
the same directory as `index.html`.

A user can't edit, rename or delete a predefined inquiry. The rest operations
are available.
