# sqliteviz

**Note: This is a work-in-progress project.**

Sqliteviz is a single-page application for fully client-side visualisation of SQLite databases.
It's a kind of middleground between [Plotly Falcon][1] and [Redash][2].
It is built on top of [react-chart-editor][3] and [sql.js][4] in [Vue.js][5]. 

## Features

1. Ad-hoc and prepared visualisation of a SQLite database using flexibility
   of SQL and richness of Plotly's `react-chart-editor` 
2. Visualisation pallete, SQL and chart definitions, kept in local
   storage with import/export
3. Integration-side provided pallete
